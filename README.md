# Marketing Budget Allocation Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing budget allocations for marketing channels based on ROI estimates provided by two consulting firms. Our goal was to identify the most effective allocation strategy to maximize profits while minimizing risks associated with ROI projection inaccuracies.

### Key Achievements

**Stable Allocation Model:** Recommended a more stable allocation model from the first consulting firm, reducing potential profit decline due to inaccuracies in ROI projections.

**Model Robustness:** Validated the robustness of our model against variations in channel returns, ensuring consistent profit achievement.

**Reinvestment Plan:** Proposed a reinvestment plan of half the monthly ROI, projecting a total profit boost to $2.68M.

### Methodology

1. Data Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of optimal budget allocations for marketing channels based on ROI estimates.

2. Model Evaluation: Utilized Gurobi to optimize budget allocations and assess the stability of different allocation models.

3. Sensitivity Analysis: Examined the impact of variations in channel returns on overall profit and model performance.
